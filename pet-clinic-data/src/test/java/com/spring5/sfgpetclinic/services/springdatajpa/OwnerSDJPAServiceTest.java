     * Read below post to understand the difference between @Mock and @Inject Mock
     * https://howtodoinjava.com/mockito/mockito-mock-injectmocks/
     *
     * @Mock creates mock objects
     * A mock object is an interface to hide a dependency with cannot be tested
     * in test environment e.g. database, network locations etc.A method invoked
     * using mocked reference does not execute method body defined in class file,
     * rather the method behavior is configured using when-thenReturn methods combinations.
     * Use @Mock to create mocks which are needed to support testing of class to be tested.
     * @InjectMock creates an actual instance of the class
     * In a junit test, we create objects for the class which needs to be
     * tested and itâ€™s methods to be invoked.
     * Use @InjectMocks to create class instances which needs to be tested in test class.
     * Use @InjectMocks when actual method body needs to be executed for a given class.
     * Use @InjectMocks when we need all internal dependencies initialized with mock
     * objects to work method correctly.
